Assessing the sales performance of the pizza shop for the pizza shop.
Processing, analyzing, and visualizing datasets using Python (pandas, matplotlib.pyplot). 
The purpose of this project is to assess sales performance and adjust the supply of ingredients for the upcoming year.

Points of Interest
1. Sales performance of pizza shop
2. Total quantity of ingredients used throughout the year

Conclusion

1. The highest sales day falls on Friday, and the peak sales month is May and July.
2. Customers prefer classic category pizzas, and they tend to order large-sized pizzas.
3. Garlic, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and chicken are frequently used ingredients throughout the year.
4. The Classic pizza category tends to have lower unit prices. The Classic pizza category is also the most frequently purchased or the most favorite, which may occur due to its relatively affordable price.

Recommendations

1. Consider adding extra staff to the pizza shop on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.
2. Reevaluate the production of The Brie Carre Pizza due to its lower popularity.
3. Simplify the pizza size options to small, medium, and large.
4. Increase stock levels for ingredients such as garlic, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and chicken due to their frequent usage.
5. The majority of customers only buy 1 pizza. To increase sales, attractive promo can also be implemented to encourage customers to buy more than 1 pizza. The quantity and unit price have a significant correlation with the total price. For promo, we can also slightly decrease the unit price, with the hope that the quantity will increase, thus resulting in an increase in total sales.
